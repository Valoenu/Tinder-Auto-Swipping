Got it! Hereâ€™s a short and friendly `README.md` written from the perspective of a software development student sharing a personal automation project on GitHub:

# ðŸ“¡ Internet Speed Twitter Bot

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software development student, and this is a fun little automation project I built using Python and Selenium.

The idea is simple: this bot checks your internet speed using [Speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net) and automatically tweets at your Internet Service Provider (ISP) if the speed is slower than what youâ€™re paying for.

## ðŸ’» What It Does

- Opens Speedtest.net and runs a speed test
- Checks if the actual download/upload speed is lower than your expected speed
- Logs into Twitter and posts a tweet complaining about it

## ðŸ§° What You Need

- Python 3 installed
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed
- [ChromeDriver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) (should match your Chrome version)
- Python package: `selenium`

TWITTER_EMAIL = 'your-twitter-email'
TWITTER_PASSWORD = 'your-twitter
