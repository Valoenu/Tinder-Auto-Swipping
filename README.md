# Tinder-Auto-Swipping
This Python script automates swiping on Tinder using Selenium. It logs into Tinder via a web browser, handles pop-ups, and continuously “likes” profiles by clicking the like button. Useful for testing or automation experiments. Note: Use responsibly and respect platform terms of service.
